Java Projects using Data Structures and Algorithms

Autocomplete:
• Developed an efficient autocomplete system, which sorts queries by weight and prefix using custom comparators
• Optimized lookup for term suggestions given a prefix with a variant of binary search, which finds the first and last
occurences of a prefix in reverse weight order
• Created interactive GUI to demonstrate the autocomplete feature

Seam Carving:
• Implemented a seam carving algorithm for content-aware image resizing, dynamically reducing image dimensions by
removing least important pixel paths
• Used dynamic programming for efficient identification of vertical and horizontal seams with minimal energy
